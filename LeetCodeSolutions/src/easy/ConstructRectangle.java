	 * For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. 
	 * So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular 
	 * web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
	 * 
	 * 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
	 * 
	 * 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
	 * 
	 * 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
	 * 
	 * You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
